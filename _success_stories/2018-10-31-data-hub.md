A large international oil company wanted to create a global platform to develop advanced data analytics projects. We helped the CDO (Chief Data Officer) and the management of the Data Hub to take decisions about the design of the platform and the assessment of Big Data & Analytics use cases. We also developed the internal methodology for the data projects across the entire company's value chain, from oil prospection and extraction to filling station sales.
