title: Optimization of sales at airports 
---

An international Airport Services Company wanted to optimize the boarding gates allocation of national and international flights with the aim of maximizing the sales in airport's shops and duty free. We performed a thoughtful analysis of many related data sources from an international LATAM airport and built several predictive models of the sales expected by each combination of flight and gate. With this information the gate allocation systems can maximize the sales of airport shops while keeping the rest of flight requirements intact.
