We are helping the leading non-life insurance company in Spain and Latin America to develop their own AI systems for advanced machine vision and object recognition. We have teamed with the Advanced Analytics unit to develop high-performance and high-accuracy object detection models using state-of-the-art Deep Learning techniques. We are also reducing the time-to-market of new Artificial Intelligence products thanks to an agile microservice architecture for the deployment of Deep Learning models into production environments.
