title: Design of a global platform and methodology for data projects
---

A multinational company in the energy sector wanted to create a platform to develop projects related with data. We helped the CDO (Chief Data Officer) and the management of the Data Hub to take decisions about the design of platform. We also developed the internal methodology for the data projects related with all the value chain, from petrol extraction to the fuel sales to the end user.
